# NgVirtualList Swipe Image Demo

✨ NgVirtualList Swipe Image Demo (ng-virtual-list-swipe-image) is an Angular-based showcase application designed to demonstrate high-performance rendering of long message history using virtual scrolling techniques.

The main task was to implement a virtual list with dynamically height elements using virtual scrolling.

The project uses dependencies only from the Angular ecosystem and [ng-virtual-list](https://github.com/DjonnyX/ng-virtual-list) without implementing third-party solutions.

<b>Angular version 20.X.X</b>.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- List virtualization: Efficiently displays thousands of messages with minimal memory usage and no lag.
- Smooth user interface: Handles dynamic content height and maintains scroll position during real-time updates.
- Modern stack: Built using Angular and the ng-virtual-list library.
- Interactive testing: Includes a real-time message simulator to test list behavior under load.
- Implemented a virtual scroll handler, ensuring stable scrolling on all platforms.
- Implemented a UI kit using SVG components with a unique design and animation.
- Full multilingual support and interface adaptation for right-to-left languages.
- Implemented full theming.
- Works correctly in all browsers and platforms.

## 🧩 Purpose and Problems Solved
This project addresses performance issues when working with long lists of chat messages:

- DOM overload: without virtualization, the browser attempts to display all messages at once, even those not visible to the user;
- Scrolling slowdown: with thousands of messages, scrolling becomes laggy;
- High memory consumption: storing all elements in memory reduces overall application performance.
- Virtual scrolling solves these issues by displaying only the messages visible to the user and a small buffer around them.

<br/>

## ⚡Advantages of this approach
- High performance: smooth scrolling even with 100,000+ elements;
- Low memory consumption: only visible elements are stored in memory;
- Flexibility: support for dynamic sizes, grouping, and animation;
- Integration with Angular: native template syntax, reactive forms;
- Ease of setup: minimal code changes required for implementation.
